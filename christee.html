                    This website is an archive of the software and hardware for the NASA Robotic/Lunar
                    Mining team at the University of Akron.  We have put together this website to collectively
                    hold the work that we performed on our robots for the years of 2012, 2013, and 2014.
                    We have posted out work so that others can learn from the materials and so that
                    other teams participating in the future can learn from what we learned throughout
                    our years participating in the compeition. <br> <br>

                    So take a look at the various tabs that house our past robots.  On each of the pages
                    we have outlined the challaneges that each of the designs had and what we learned
                    from each of them.  There are links to designs and code for the robot as well
                    on each of the pages.  All of our designs and code have been comitted to Github
                    to help ease finding the material. <br> <br>

                    If you have any questions feel free to ask us!  You can reach us by checking
                    out our group Github and reaching out to one of the members of the group.
